  abstract = "In this review, we focus on a group of mobile genetic elements
              designated pathogenicity islands (PAI). These elements play a
              pivotal role in the virulence of bacterial pathogens of humans
              and are also essential for virulence in pathogens of animals and
              plants. Characteristic molecular features of PAI of important
              human pathogens and their role in pathogenesis are described. The
              availability of a large number of genome sequences of pathogenic
              bacteria and their benign relatives currently offers a unique
              opportunity for the identification of novel pathogen-specific
              genomic islands. However, this knowledge has to be complemented
              by improved model systems for the analysis of virulence functions
              of bacterial pathogens. PAI apparently have been acquired during
              the speciation of pathogens from their nonpathogenic or
              environmental ancestors. The acquisition of PAI not only is an
              ancient evolutionary event that led to the appearance of
              bacterial pathogens on a timescale of millions of years but also
              may represent a mechanism that contributes to the appearance of
              new pathogens within a human life span. The acquisition of
              knowledge about PAI, their structure, their mobility, and the
              pathogenicity factors they encode not only is helpful in gaining
              a better understanding of bacterial evolution and interactions of
              pathogens with eukaryotic host cells but also may have important
              practical implications such as providing delivery systems for
              vaccination, tools for cell biology, and tools for the
              development of new strategies for therapy of bacterial
              infections.",

  author   = "Gal-Mor, Ohad and Finlay, B Brett",
  abstract = "Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) are distinct genetic elements on the
              chromosomes of a large number of bacterial pathogens. PAIs encode
              various virulence factors and are normally absent from
              non-pathogenic strains of the same or closely related species.
              PAIs are considered to be a subclass of genomic islands that are
              acquired by horizontal gene transfer via transduction,
              conjugation and transformation, and provide 'quantum leaps' in
              microbial evolution. Data based on numerous sequenced bacterial
              genomes demonstrate that PAIs are present in a wide range of both
              gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens of humans,
              animals and plants. Recent research focused on PAIs has not only
              led to the identification of many novel virulence factors used by
              these species during infection of their respective hosts, but
              also dramatically changed our way of thinking about the evolution
              of bacterial virulence.",

              and Barnich, Nicolas and Delmas, Julien and Bonnet, Richard",
  abstract = "Escherichia coli is a versatile bacterial species that includes
              both harmless commensal strains and pathogenic strains found in
              the gastrointestinal tract in humans and warm-blooded animals.
              The growing amount of DNA sequence information generated in the
              era of ``genomics'' has helped to increase our understanding of
              the factors and mechanisms involved in the diversification of
              this bacterial species. The pathogenic side of E. coli that is
              afforded through horizontal transfers of genes encoding virulence
              factors enables this bacterium to become a highly diverse and
              adapted pathogen that is responsible for intestinal or
              extraintestinal diseases in humans and animals. Many of the
              accessory genes acquired by horizontal transfers form syntenic
              blocks and are recognized as genomic islands (GIs). These genomic
              regions contribute to the rapid evolution, diversification and
              adaptation of E. coli variants because they are frequently
              subject to rearrangements, excision and transfer, as well as to
              further acquisition of additional DNA. Here, we review a subgroup
              of GIs from E. coli termed pathogenicity islands (PAIs), a
              concept defined in the late 1980s by J{\"o}rg Hacker and
              colleagues in Werner Goebel's group at the University of
              W{\"u}rzburg, W{\"u}rzburg, Germany. As with other GIs, the PAIs
              comprise large genomic regions that differ from the rest of the
              genome by their G + C content, by their typical insertion within
              transfer RNA genes, and by their harboring of direct repeats (at
              their ends), integrase determinants, or other mobility loci. The
              hallmark of PAIs is their contribution to the emergence of
              virulent bacteria and to the development of intestinal and
              extraintestinal diseases. This review summarizes the current
              knowledge on the structure and functional features of PAIs, on
              PAI-encoded E. coli pathogenicity factors and on the role of PAIs
              in host-pathogen interactions.",

  abstract = "Pathogenicity is a complex multifactorial process confounded by
              the concerted activity of genetic regions associated with
              virulence and/or resistance determinants. Pathogenicity islands
              (PAIs) and resistance islands (REIs) are key to the evolution of
              pathogens and appear to play complimentary roles in the process
              of bacterial infection. While PAIs promote disease development,
              REIs give a fitness advantage to the host against multiple
              antimicrobial agents. The Pathogenicity Island Database (PAIDB,
              http://www.paidb.re.kr) has been the only database dedicated to
              providing comprehensive information on all reported PAIs and
              candidate PAIs in prokaryotic genomes. In this study, we present
              PAIDB v2.0, whose functionality is extended to incorporate REIs.
              PAIDB v2.0 contains 223 types of PAIs with 1331 accessions, and
              88 types of REIs with 108 accessions. With an improved detection
              scheme, 2673 prokaryotic genomes were analyzed to locate
              candidate PAIs and REIs. With additional quantitative and
              qualitative advancements in database content and detection
              accuracy, PAIDB will continue to facilitate pathogenomic studies
              of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms.",
